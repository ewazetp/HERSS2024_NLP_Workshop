# NLP Workshop

## Thomas T. Hills

This repository provides materials for my Natural Language Processing workshop.  

You will find:

  1. Slides in pdf form
  2. Rmarkdown code for demonstrating key NLP techniques
  3. Data files for use with the R code
  4. A copy of the Hills and Miani primer on Natural Language Processing

To run the code:
1. download the files as a zip file.
2. unzip it
3. run the .Rmd file in Rstudio (you may need to download Rstudio and the latest version of R)
4. Make sure to 'Set Working Directory' to the same folder with the .Rmd file.
5. Then run the .Rmd code chunks and it should work.
